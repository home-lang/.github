## What is Home?

Home is a modern programming language for systems and application development that delivers fast compile times, memory safety without ceremony, and APIs that spark joy. [Crafting](https://github.com/home-lang/craft) cross-platform apps has never been easier.

```home
import basics/http { Server }

fn main() {
  let server = Server.bind(":3000")

  server.get("/", fn(req) -> async Response {
    return Response.json({ message: "Welcome Home! 🏡" })
  })

  server.listen()
}
```

**File Extensions:** `.home` or `.hm`

**Package Manager:** `pantry/` for dependencies • `.freezer` for lockfiles

**Configuration:** `home.toml` • `couch.toml` • `couch.json(c)`
